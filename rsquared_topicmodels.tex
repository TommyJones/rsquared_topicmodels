% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%

%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

This document proposes a new (old) metric for evaluating goodness of fit
in topic models, the coefficient of determination, or \(R^2\). Within
the context of topic modeling, \(R^2\) has the same interpretation that
it does when used in a broader class of statistical models. Reporting
\(R^2\) with topic models addresses two current problems in topic
modeling: a lack of standard cross-contextual evaluation metrics for
topic modeling and ease of communication with lay audiences. This paper
proposes that \(R^2\) should be reported as a standard metric when
constructing topic models.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

According to an often-quoted but never cited definition, ``the goodness
of fit of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of
observations. Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the
discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the
model in question.''\footnote{This quote appears verbatim on Wikipedia
  and countless books, papers, and websites.} Goodness of fit measures
vary with the goals of those constructing the statistical model.
Inferential goals may emphasize in-sample fit while predictive goals may
emphasize out-of-sample fit. Prior information may be included in the
goodness of fit measure for Bayesian models, or it may not. Goodness of
fit measures may include methods to correct for model overfitting. In
short, goodness of fit measures the performance of a statistical model
against the ground truth of observed data. Fitting the data well is
generally a necessary---though not sufficient---condition for trust in a
statistical model, whatever its goals.

Of course, goodness of fit is only one concern in statistical modeling.
Researchers may trade some goodness of fit for ease of interpretation.
For example, many accurate and robust predictive models are
non-parametric ``black boxes'', making inference difficult. Researchers
may trade off some goodness of fit for interpretability by selecting a
more restrictive parametric model. If the emphasis is on prediction,
researchers may trade some in-sample fit for predictive robustness. This
is cited as one motivation for using the Bayesian latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) topic model over the frequentist probabilistic latent
semantic analysis (pLSA). It is alleged that pLSA tends to over fit its
training sample, making its estimates fragile to the introduction of new
data. (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) Under certain conditions, pLSA and LDA
are equivalent models, however. Girolami and Kabán (2003)

Goodness of fit manifests itself in topic modeling through word
frequencies. It is a common misconception that topic models are
fully-unsupervised methods. If true, this would mean that no outcomes
exist upon which to compare a model's fitted values. However, topic
models are ultimately generative models of word frequencies. The
expected value of a document under a topic model are given by the
expected value of a multinomial random variable. The outcomes, then, are
the word frequencies themselves. Most goodness of fit measures in topic
modeling are restricted to in-sample fit. However, some out-of-sample
measures have been developed. Buntine (2009)

\hypertarget{probabilistic-topic-models}{%
\section{Probabilistic Topic Models}\label{probabilistic-topic-models}}

Probabilistic topic models are a family of stochastic models for
estimating abstract ``topics'' in a set of documents. Many methods have
been developed to provide a flexible family of topic models. Some
include frequently available metadata about documents, such as the time
of the publication {[}CITE DYNAMIC TOPIC MODELS{]}, or the author and
location of the publication {[}CITE{]}. Most probabilistic topic models
are Bayesian, though probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) is
frequentist. {[}CITE{]} Without loss of generality, all probabilistic
topic models model the document-generating process as a mixture of
multinomial distributions.\footnote{The terms ``multinomial'' and
  ``categorical'' are often used interchangeably in the topic modeling
  literature.} Probabilistic topic models estimate parameters of an
idealized stochastic process for how words get on the page. Instead of
writing full, syntatictically-coherent, sentences, the author samples a
topic from a multinomial distribution and then given the topic samples a
word. The process for a single draw of the \(n\)-th word for the
\(d\)-th document, \(w_{d,n}\), is

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample \(z_{d,n}\sim\) \(\text{Multinomial}(1,\boldsymbol\theta_d)\)
\item
  Sample \(w_{d,n}\sim\)
  \(\text{Multinomial}(1,\boldsymbol\phi_{z_{d,n}})\)
\end{enumerate}

The variable \(z_{d,n}\) is latent. The author repeats this process
\(Nd\) times until the document is ``complete''. For a corpus of \(D\)
documents, \(V\) unique tokens, and \(K\) latent topics, the goal is to
estimate two matrices: \(\boldsymbol\Theta\) and \(\boldsymbol\Phi\).
The \(d\)-th row of \(\boldsymbol\Theta\) comprises
\(\boldsymbol\theta_d\), above. And the \(k\)-th row of
\(\boldsymbol\Phi\) comprises \(\boldsymbol\phi_k\).\footnote{LDA
  estimates these parameters by placing Dirichlet priors on \(\theta_d\)
  and \(\phi_k\).} The document term matrix (DTM)---\(\mathbf{Y}\)---can
be thought of as the result of repeated sampling from
\(\boldsymbol\Theta\) and \(\boldsymbol\Phi\). In expectation we have
the following relationship:

\begin{align}
  E(\mathbf{Y}) &= \mathbf{n} \odot \Theta \cdot \Phi
\end{align}

Above, \(\mathbf{n}\) is a \(D\)-length vector whose \(d\)-th entry is
the number of terms in the \(d\)-th document and \(\odot\) denotes
elementwise multiplication.

\hypertarget{evaluation-metrics-for-topic-models}{%
\section{Evaluation Metrics for Topic
Models}\label{evaluation-metrics-for-topic-models}}

The primary goodness of fit measures in topic modeling are likelihood
methods. Likelihoods, generally the log likelihood, are naturally
obtained from probabilistic topic models. Likelihoods may contain prior
information, as is often the case with Bayesian models. If prior
information is unknown or undesired, researchers may calculate the
likelihood using only estimated parameters. Researchers have used
likelihoods to select the number of topics{[}CITE{]}, compare
priors{[}CITE{]}, or otherwise evaluate the efficacy of different
modeling procedures. {[}CITE{]} {[}CITE{]} A popular likelihood method
for evaluating out-of-sample fit is called perplexity. Perplexity
measures a transformation of the likelihood of the held-out words
conditional on the trained model.

Non-likelihood measures are less-commonly used. Some of these methods
bridge the gap between interpretation and goodness of fit. One such
method is the intruder test.{[}CITE{]} The intruder test uses human
judgment. Judges are shown a few high-probability words in a topic, with
one low-probability word mixed in. Judges must find the low-probability
word, the intruder. They then repeat the procedure with documents
instead of words. A good topic model should allow judges to easily
detect the intruders. Coherence is a measure attempting to approximate
the results of intruder tests in an automated fashion. {[}CITE{]} The
coherence of a topic is a sum of log ratios of word co-occurance across
documents. Researchers have used precision and recall methods such as
the area under a ROC curve (AUC) on topically-tagged corpora.{[}CITE{]}
The most prevalent topic in each document is taken as a document's
topical classification.

Though useful, current evaluation metrics in topic modeling are
difficult to interpret, are inappropriate for use in topic modeling, or
are cannot be produced easily. Intruder tests are time consuming and
costly, making intruder tests infeasible to conduct regularly. Coherence
is not primarily a goodness of fit measure. AUC is nicely bound between
0 and 1, with 0.5 representing ``as good as random guessing''. Yet
precision and recall measures mis-represent topic models as binary
classifiers. This misrepresentation ignores one fundamental motivation
for using topic models: allowing documents to contain multiple topics.
Precision and recall measures also require substantial subjective
judgement. Researchers must examine the high-probability words in a
topic and decide that it does or does not correspond to the corpus tags.

Likelihoods have an intuitive definition: the probability of observing
the training data if the model is true. Yet properties of the underlying
corpus influence the scale of the likelihood function. Adding more
documents, having a larger vocabulary, and even having longer documents
all reduce the likelihood. Likelihoods of multiple models on the same
corpus can be compared. (Researchers often do this to help select the
number of topics for a final model.){[}CITE{]} Topic models on different
corpora cannot be compared, however. One corpus may have 1,000 documents
and 5,000 tokens, while another may have 10,000 documents and 25,000
tokens. The likelihood of a model on the latter corpus will be much
smaller than a model on the former. Yet this does not indicate the model
on the latter corpus is a worse fit; the likeli- hood function is simply
on a different scale. Perplexity is a transformation of the likelihood
for out-of-sample documents. The transformation makes perplexity
less-intuitively interpreted than a raw likelihood. Perplexity's scale
is influenced by the same factors as the likelihood.

\hypertarget{the-coefficient-of-determination-r2}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The Coefficient of Determination:
\(R^2\)}{The Coefficient of Determination: R\^{}2}}\label{the-coefficient-of-determination-r2}}

The coefficient of determination is a popular, intuitive, and
easily-interpretable goodness of fit measure. The coefficient of
determination, denoted \(R^2\), is most common in ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression. However, researchers have developed \(R^2\) and
several pseudo \(R^2\) measures for many classes of statistical models.
The largest value of \(R^2\) is 1, indicating a model fits the data
perfectly. The formal definition of \(R^2\) (below) is
interpreted---without loss of generality---as the proportion of
\emph{variability} in the data that is explained by the model. For
linear models with outcomes in \(\mathbb{R}_1\), \(R^2\) is bound
between 0 and 1 and is the proportion of \emph{variance} in the data
explained by the model.{[}CITE{]} Even outside of the context of a
linear model, \(R^2\) retains its maximum of 1 and its interpretation as
the proportion of explained variability. Negative values of \(R^2\) are
possible for non-linear models or models in \(\mathbb{R}_m\) where
\(m > 1\). These negative values indicate that simply guessing the mean
outcome is a better fit than the model.\footnote{In this author's
  experience, negative values indicate an error in one's code, rather
  than simply due to an exceptionally poor fitting model.}

\hypertarget{the-standard-definition-of-r2}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Standard Definition of
\(R^2\)}{The Standard Definition of R\^{}2}}\label{the-standard-definition-of-r2}}

For a model, \(f\), of outcome variable, \(y\), where there are \(n\)
observations, \(R^2\) is derived from the following:

\begin{align}
  \bar{y} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\\
  SS_{tot.} &= \sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}\\
  SS_{resid.} &= \sum_{i=1}^n{(f_i-y_i)^2}
\end{align}

Thus, the standard definition of \(R^2\) is a ratio of summed squared
errors.

\begin{align}
    R^2 \equiv 1 - \frac{SS_{resid.}}{SS_{tot.}}
\end{align}

\hypertarget{a-geometric-interpretation-of-r2}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{A Geometric Interpretation of
\(R^2\)}{A Geometric Interpretation of R\^{}2}}\label{a-geometric-interpretation-of-r2}}

\(R^2\) has a geometric interpretation as well. \(SS_{tot.}\) is the
total squared-euclidean distance from each \(y_i\) to the mean outcome,
\(\bar{y}\). Then \(SS_{resid.}\) is the total squared-euclidean
distance from each \(y_i\) to its predicted value under the model,
\(f_i\). Recall that for any two points
\(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}_m\)

\begin{align}
    d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^m{(p_j - q_j)^2}}
\end{align}

where \(d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})\) denotes the euclidean distance
between \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\mathbf{q}\). \(R^2\) is often taught in
the context of OLS where \(y_i, f_i \in \mathbb{R}_1\). In that case,
\(d(y_i, f_i) = \sqrt{(y_i - f_i)^2}\); by extension
\(d(y_i, \bar{y}) = \sqrt{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}\). In the multidimensional
case where \(\mathbf{y}_i, \mathbf{f}_i \in \mathbb{R}_m; m > 1\), then
\(\bar{\mathbf{y}} \in \mathbb{R}_m\) represents the point at the center
of \(\mathbf{y}\) in \(\mathbb{R}_m\).\footnote{In the one-dimensional
  case, where \(y_i , f_i \in \mathbb{R}_1\), \(SS_{resid.}\) can be
  considered the squared-euclidean distance between the
  \(n\)-dimensional vectors \(y\) and \(f\). However, this relationship
  does not hold when
  \(\mathbf{y}_i , \mathbf{f}_i \in \mathbb{R}_m ; m > 1\).}

We can rewrite \(R^2\) using the relationships above.

\begin{align}
    \bar{\mathbf{y}}_v &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i,v} 
      \text{, the $v$-th entry of the vector $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$} \\ 
    SS_{tot.} &= \sum_{i=1}^n{d(\mathbf{y}_i, \bar{\mathbf{y}}})^2\\
    SS_{resid.} &= \sum_{i=1}^n{d(\mathbf{y}_i, \mathbf{f}_i)^2}\\
    \Rightarrow R^2 &= 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{d(y_i, f_i)^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^n{d(y_i, \bar{y})^2}}
\end{align}

Figure {[}REFERENCE FIGURE{]} visualizes the geometric interpretation of
\(R^2\) for outcomes in \(\mathbb{R}_2\). The left image represents
\(SS_{tot.}\): the red dots are data points(\(y_i\)); the black dot is
the mean (\(\bar{y}\)); the line segments represent the euclidean
distance from each \(y_i\) to \(\bar{y}\). \(SS_{tot.}\) is obtained by
squaring the length of each line segment and then adding them together.
The right image represents \(SS_{resid.}\): the blue dots are the fitted
values under the model (\(f_i\)); the line segments represent the
euclidean distance from each \(f_i\) to its corresponding \(y_i\).

\end{figure}

The geometric interpretation of \(R^2\) is similar to the
``explained-variance'' interpretation. When \(SS_{resid.} = 0\), then
the model is a perfect fit for the data and \(R^2 = 1\). If
\(SS_{resid.} = SS_{tot.}\), then \(R^2 = 0\) and the model is no better
than just guessing \(\bar{y}\). When \(0 < SS_{resid} < SS_{tot}\), then
the model is a better fit for the data than a naive guess of
\(\bar{y}\). In a non-linear or multi-dimensional model, it is possible
for \(SS_{resid.} > SS_{tot.}\). In this case, \(R^2\) is negative, and
guessing \(\bar{y}\) is better than using the model.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Extending \(R^2\) to Topic
Models}{Extending R\^{}2 to Topic Models}}\label{extending-r2-to-topic-models}}

An \(R^2\) for topic models follows from the geometric interpretation of
\(R^2\). For a document, \(d\), the observed value, \(y_d\), is a vector
of integers counting the number of times each token appears in \(N_d\)
draws. The document's fitted value under the model follows that \(y_d\)
represents the outcome of a multinomial random variable. The fitted
value is \(f_d = N_d \cdot \theta_d \cdot \Phi^T\). The center of the
documents in the corpus, \(\bar{y}\), is obtained by averaging the
occurrence of each token across all documents. From this we obtain
\(R^2\).

\begin{align}
    \bar{y}_v &= \frac{1}{D}\sum_{d=1}^{D}y_{d,v}\\
    SS_{tot.} &= \sum_{d=1}^D{d(y_d, \bar{y})^2}\\
    SS_{resid.} &= \sum_{d=1}^D{d(y_d, f_d)^2}\\
    R^2 &\equiv 1 - \frac{SS_{resid.}}{SS_{tot.} }
\end{align}

\hypertarget{pseudo-coefficients-of-variation}{%
\subsection{Pseudo Coefficients of
Variation}\label{pseudo-coefficients-of-variation}}

Several pseudo coefficients of variation have been developed for models
where the traditional \(R^2\) is inappropriate. Some of these, such as
the Cox and Snell's \(R^2\) \cite{cox89} or McFadden's \(R^2\)
\cite{mcfadden77} may apply to topic models. As pointed out by
\emph{UCLA's Institute for Digital Research and Education},\cite{ucla}

\begin{quote}
These are `pseudo' R-squareds because they look like R-squared in the sense that they are on a similar scale, ranging from 0 to 1 (though some pseudo R-squareds never achieve 0 or 1) with higher values indicating better model fit, but they cannot be interpreted as one would interpret an OLS R-squared and different pseudo R-squareds can arrive at very different values. 
\end{quote}

The empirical section of this paper calculates an un-corrected
McFadden's \(R^2\) for topic models to compare to the standard
(non-pseudo) \(R^2\). McFadden's \(R^2\) is defined as

\begin{align}
    R^2_{Mc} & \equiv 1 - \frac{ ln( L_{full} ) }{ ln( L_{restricted} ) }\\
\end{align}

where \$ L\_\{full\} \$ is the estimated likelihood of the data under
the model and \$ L\_\{restricted\} \$ is the estimated likelihood of the
data free of the model. In the context of OLS, the restricted model is a
regression with only an intercept term. For other types of model (such
as topic models), care should be taken in selecting what ``free of the
model'' means.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Empirical Evaluation of Topic Model
\(R^2\)}{Empirical Evaluation of Topic Model R\^{}2}}\label{empirical-evaluation-of-topic-model-r2}}

This paper performs three analyses to empirically evaluate \(R^2\) for
topic models. Two analyses use Monte Carlo-simulated corpora and one
uses a corpus of grants awarded through the Department of Health and
Human Services. This latter corpus was obtained from the National
Institutes of Health \emph{NIH ExPORTER} database. \cite{nih} The first
analysis uses simulated corpora to observe how the properties of
training corpora influence \(R^2\). The second analysis uses these same
simulated corpora to compare \(R^2\) as commonly-defined to McFadden's
\(R^2\) in the context of topic modeling. The final analysis compares
the \(R^2\) values of various models constructed on the NIH corpus.

\hypertarget{monte-carlo-simulated-corpora}{%
\subsection{Monte Carlo-Simulated
Corpora}\label{monte-carlo-simulated-corpora}}

It is possible to simulate corpora that are statistically-consistent to
human-generated language. St.~Thomas and Jones derive this method in a
working paper recently submitted for peer review. \cite{stthomas15} This
method generates a corpus of \(D\) documents, \(V\) tokens, and \(K\)
topics through the following stochastic process.

\begin{align}
    \beta_{k, v} \sim Pareto(1, \gamma) && k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \\
    \phi_k \sim Dirichlet_V(\beta_k) && k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \\
    \theta_d \sim Dirichlet_K(\alpha) && d \in \{1, \ldots, D\} \\
    N_d \sim Poisson(\lambda) &&  d \in \{1, \ldots, D\} \\
    z_{d,n} \sim Categorical_K(\theta_d) && d \in \{1, \ldots, D\}, n \in \{1, \ldots, N_d \} \\
    v_{k,n} \sim Categorical_V(\phi_k) && k \in \{1, \ldots, K\},  n \in \{1, \ldots, N_d \} \\
\end{align}

The words for document \(d\) are populated by sampling with replacement
from \(z_{d,n}\) and \(v_{k,n}\) for \(N_d\) iterations. The parameters
\(V\), \(K\), and \(\lambda\) may be varied to adjust the corpus
properties for the number of tokens, topics, and average document length
respectively. \(\beta_k\) is drawn from a Pareto distribution to
generate corpora consistent with Zipf's law. The parameter of the Pareto
distribution, \(\gamma\), may be estimated from an existing corpus;
St.~Thomas and Jones set \(\gamma = 1.1\). The index, \(v\), of each
token is permuted for each \(\beta_k\) to ensure heterogeneity of the
simulated topics.

\hypertarget{latent-dirichlet-allocation}{%
\subsection{Latent Dirichlet
Allocation}\label{latent-dirichlet-allocation}}

This paper uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and collapsed Gibbs
sampling to estimate topic models from simulated or actual data. LDA,
possibly the most popular topic model, is a Bayesian hierarchical model
that places Dirichlet priors on \(\theta_d, \forall d\) and
\(\phi_k, \forall k\):

\begin{align*}
\phi_k \sim& Dirichlet_V(\beta) && k\in\{1, \ldots, K\} \\
{\theta}_d \sim& Dirichlet_K({\alpha}) && d\in\{1, \ldots, D\}\\
\end{align*} A limitation with LDA is that the number of topics in the
corpus must be specified a priori where no prior knowledge often exists.
Compounding the problem, LDA's posteriors are inconsistent with respect
to the number of topics. \cite{womack13} Nevertheless, LDA's empirical
utility has been overwhelmingly demonstrated, having been used since
2002. For LDA models estimated in this paper, symmetric parameters are
used for both prior distributions. Each entry of \(\alpha\) is 0.1; each
entry of \(\beta\) is 0.05.

\subsection{Comparing $R^2$ to McFadden's $R^2$}

McFadden's pseudo \(R^2\) is calculated for all simulated corpora for
comparison to the standard \(R^2\). McFadden's \(R^2\) is a ratio of
likelihoods. Various methods exist for calculating likelihoods of topic
models. \cite{buntine09} Most of these methods have a Bayesian
perspective and incorporate prior information. Not all topic models are
Bayesian, however. And in the case of simulated corpora, the exact
data-generating parameters are known a priori. As a result, likelihoods
calculated for this paper follow the simplest definition: the
probability of observing the generated data, given the (known or
estimated) multinomial parameters of the model. The
\texttt{model-free"\ likelihood\ assumes\ that\ each\ document\ is\ generated\ by\ drawing\ from\ a\ single\ multinomial\ distribution.\ The\ parameters\ of\ this}model-free"
distribution are proportional to the frequency of each token in the
data.

\subsection{Empirical Properties of $R^2$ for Topic Models}

The \(R^2\) for topic models has the following empirical properties: It
is bound between \(-\infty\) and 1. \(R^2\) is invariant to the
\textit{true} number of topics in the corpus. \(R^2\) increases with the
\textit{estimated} number of topics using LDA. This indicates a risk of
model over fit in selecting too many topics (discussed in more detail in
the next section). \(R^2\) decreases slightly as the vocabulary size of
the corpus increases. There are \textit{large} increases in \(R^2\) as
the average document length increases. Figures depicting these
properties are in the Appendix.

Most of these empirical properties were obtained by using simulated
corpora, as described earlier in the paper, with one exception. The
default parameter settings for Monte Carlo simulation are \(K = 50\)
topics, \(D = 2,000\) documents, \(V = 5,000\) tokens, and
\(\lambda = 500\) for the average document length, which is distributed
\(Poisson(\lambda)\). Each parameter was varied, holding other
parameters constant. In each case, Monte Carlo simulation generates a
document term matrix for the corpus while the parameters for generating
the documents are known. \(R^2\) is calculated for each simulated
corpus, using the population parameters. These \(R^2\) metrics represent
a best-case scenario, avoiding misspecification and other pathologies
present with topic model estimation algorithms.

McFadden's pseudo \(R^2\) is also calculated for these simulated data.
McFadden's \(R^2\) is uniformly lower than the standard \(R^2\).
McFadden's \(R^2\) is subject to the common problem of many pseudo
\(R^2\) measures; its true upper bound is less than one. This makes
sense. If McFadden's \(R^2\) were to equal 1, then the likelihood of the
data would be 1 which is impossible. It is never the case that a
likelihood will equal 1. Given the scale of linguistic data, the
likelihood will always be significantly less than 1. Therefore, a scale
correction measure is needed, making McFadden's \(R^2\) more
complicated.

McFadden's \(R^2\) increases with the number of true topics; this is
problematic. When the scale of an \(R^2\) varies with \textit{known}
properties of the data, such as the number of documents, vocabulary
size, average document length, etc. scale correction measures are
possible. However, when the metric varies with an \textit{unknown}
property, such as the number of latent topics, then a scale correction
is not possible. For this reason alone, McFadden's \(R^2\) is
undesirable. Other properties of McFadden's \(R^2\) are consistent with
the properties of the standard \(R^2\)

These properties of \(R^2\) compel a change in focus for the topic
modeling research community. Document length is an important factor in
model fit whereas the number of documents is not. When choosing between
fitting a topic model on short abstracts, full-page documents, or
multi-page papers, it appears that more text is better. Second, since
model fit is invariant for corpora over 1,000 documents (our lower bound
for simulation), sampling from large corpora should yield reasonable
estimates of population parameters. The topic modeling community has
heretofore focused on scalability on large corpora of
hundreds-of-thousands to millions of documents. Little attention has
been paid to document length, however. These results, if robust,
indicate that focus should move away from larger corpora and towards
lengthier documents.

\subsection{Comparison of Simulated Data with the NIH Corpus}

\(R^2\) increases with the \textit{estimated} number of topics using
LDA. This indicates a risk of model over fit with respect to the number
of estimated topics. To evaluate the effect of \(R^2\) on the number of
estimated topics, LDA models were fit to two corpora. The first corpus
is simulated, using the parameter defaults: \(K = 50\), \(D = 2,000\),
\(V = 5,000\), and \(\lambda = 500\). The second corpus is on the
abstracts of 10,000 randomly-sampled research grants for fiscal year
2014 in the National Institutes of Health's ExPORTER database. In both
cases, LDA models are fit to the data estimating a range of \(K\). For
each model, \(R^2\) and the log likelihood are calculated. The known
parameters for this NIH corpus are \(D = 10,000\), \(V = 21,064\), and
the median document length is 368 words. This vocabulary has standard
stop words removed, includes bigrams as tokens, and excludes tokens that
appear in fewer than 5 documents or more than half of the corpus.

The same likelihood calculation is used here, as described above. This
likelihood calculation excludes prior information typically used when
calculating the likelihood of an LDA model. This is perhaps not the
optimal method for calculating likelihoods when using a Bayesian model.
However, this prior information is excluded here for two reasons. First,
it is consistent with the method used for calculating McFadden's \(R^2\)
earlier in the paper. Second, this log likelihood can be calculated
exactly. LDA's likelihood is contained within an intractable integral.
Various approximations have been developed. However, there is some risk
that a comparison of an approximated likelihood to \(R^2\) may be biased
by the approximation method.

{[}FIGURE HERE{]}

Figure \textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:r2ll} depicts \(R^2\) and the log
likelihood over a range of estimated \(K\) for both corpora. The left
image corresponds to the simulated corpus. The right image corresponds
to the NIH corpus. From both images, we see that \(R^2\) and the log
likelihood both increase with the number of estimated topics at
approximately the same rates, proportional to their scales. The scale of
\(R^2\) is comparable between the simulated corpus and the NIH corpus,
in spite of their differences in size. The scale of log likelihoods
between the corpora differ by orders of magnitude. In the case of the
simulated corpus, we know that the true number of topics is 50. However,
this is not clear from observing \(R^2\) or the log likelihood. \(R^2\)
does appear to flatten between 55 and 60 topics for the simulated corpus
while it continues to increase for the NIH corpus. Nevertheless, it does
not appear that \(R^2\) or this ``raw" likelihood can help find the true
number of
topics.\footnote{Note, however, that the $R^2$ for the $K = 50$ (correctly-specified) LDA model is about 0.6. This is approximately the same value obtained for $R^2$ when using the population parameters.}

In \cite{chang09}, Chang et al.~observe that there may be a trade off
between model fit and human interpretation. Specifically, they find that
humans can more-easily interpret models with fewer topics. This may be
true. As discussed in an earlier section, non-\(R^2\) goodness of fit
measures are not readily comparable across corpora and models. Because
\(R^2\) is comparable, it is now possible to quantify how much
goodness-of-fit is lost when K is lowered. This does not address any
issues arising from a pathological misspecification of the model, an
``incorrect'' K, for example. In the case of the NIH corpus, \(R^2\)
goes from 0.5 to 0.4 when the number of estimated topics is lowered from
200 to 100.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

\(R^2\) has many advantages over standard goodness of fit measures
commonly-used in topic modeling. Current goodness of fit measures are
difficult to interpret, compare across corpora, and explain to lay
audiences. \(R^2\) does not have any of these issues. Its scale is
effectively bound between 0 and 1, as negative values (though possible)
are rare and indicate extreme model misspecification. \(R^2\) may be
used to compare models of different corpora, if necessary.
Scientifically-literate lay audiences are almost uniformly familiar with
\(R^2\) in the context of linear regression; the topic model \(R^2\) has
a similar interpretation, making it an intuitive measure.

The standard (geometric) interpretation of \(R^2\) is preferred to
McFadden's pseudo \(R^2\). The effective upper bound for McFadden's
\(R^2\) is considerably smaller than 1. A scale correction measure is
needed. Also, it is debatable which likelihood calculation(s) are most
appropriate. These issues make McFadden's \(R^2\) complicated and
subjective. However, a large motivation for deriving a topic model
\(R^2\) is to remove the complications that currently hinder evaluating
and communicating about topic models. Most problematic, McFadden's
\(R^2\) varies with the number of \textit{true} topics in the data. It
is therefore unreliable in practice where the true number of topics in
unknown.

A result of this paper indicates that further study is needed on the
relationship between document length, the number of documents in a
corpus, and vocabulary size. Results reported in this paper demonstrate
that document length is a considerable factor in model fit, whereas the
number of documents (above 1,000) is not. If robust, this result
indicates that the topic modeling community may need to change focus
away from scaling estimation algorithms for large corpora. Instead, more
effort should be put towards obtaining high-quality data. Also, studying
the relationship between these parameters, along with the number of
topics, may facilitate the development of an adjusted \(R^2\), guarding
against model over fit.

Lack of consistent evaluation metrics has limited the use of topic
models as a mature statistical method. The development of an \(R^2\) for
topic modeling is no silver bullet. However it represents a step towards
establishing consistency and rigour in topic modeling. This paper
proposes reporting \(R^2\) as a standard metric alongside topic models,
as is typically done with OLS.
